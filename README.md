# EDA: Exploring trends in Popular Videos on YouTube

Extracted video and channel data from YouTube using the YouTube API in Python. I then performed exploratory data analysis on the collected data to uncover commonalities and underlying trends amongst popular videos in the US. The goal of the project was to gain insights into what factors contribute to a video's popularity and use that information to make data-driven recommendations for creating more successful videos.
